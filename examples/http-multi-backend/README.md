# HTTP Load Balancer Example

<!-- NOTE: We use absolute linking here instead of relative linking, because the terraform registry does not support
           relative linking correctly.
-->

The root folder of this repo shows an example of how to use the [HTTP Load Balancer Module](https://github.com/tnn-gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/tree/master/modules/http-load-balancer) to create a [HTTP Cloud Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/) with 

* HTTP listener
* Backend Cloud Storage Bucket with sample files
* Backend Service for an instance group with a single compute instance

## How do you run this example?

To run this example, you need to:

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
1. Make sure you are in the root folder of the repo.
1. Open up `variables.tf` and fill in variables that don't have defaults. 
1. `terraform init`.
1. `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`.

When the templates are applied, Terraform will output the IP address of the load balancer. If you specified a custom domain name, you can connect using that. 

Note that it will take up to 10 minutes for the changes to propagate, so the load balancer and the backends might not be accessible until that.
